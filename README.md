## PURPOSE

This project aims to analyse possible statistical methods to measure poverty in Italy, through the data of the Statistical Survey carried out by the Bank of Italy in 2020. In particular, three datasets are used among those available ones in the Bank of Italy's data archive, focusing on demographic, income, expenditure and consumption variables. A comparison is also made between this baseline survey and the one carried out by ISTAT on the consumption of Italian households, in the reference year, in order to have a more in-depth study of the subject. Poverty is treated from a unidimensional and multidimensional perspective. For the multivariate analysis it is used the Factor Analysis method with an application of the regression model, in order to find non-observed dimensions of the topic. The analysis is done with the software R.
